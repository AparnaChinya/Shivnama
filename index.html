                    <p> Shiva sahasranama are about 12 in number, of which the present we deal with is popular.
Mainly because it is brought out by Krishna paramatma himself. <br/>
In the context of helping Arjuna gain the Paashupata astra from Lord Shiva himself. Krishna does the japa of this sahasranama for an  entire night dusk to dawn.
Thus says the Mahabharata.<br/><br/>
This sahasranama was first got by Rishi Tandi. Thereon to Rishi Upamanyu, there on to Krishna.

							<p>The first nama is Sthirah. It is derived from the root stha, meaning stays, exists.
Sthirah is the One who stays, unchanging, is never destroyed and alone Exists.
This  is just like all shapes made out of mud keep changing, i.e pot, plate, brick, etc. But the mud in  it never changes, continues to be the same.
That means the Effects change,  but Cause remains same.
In fact, it is the mud that has assumed all these shapes yet it remains unchanging...considering it's originality. <br/>
<br/>

Pls Ponder over this statement, a vital aspect of all philosophies.
Any philosophy/argument has to stand this test to prove itself. A very technical aspect, indeed. Sorry, got carried away a bit... <br/>

Thus one who ponders over this will become the All Important personality in eveey walk of life. That is the phala to chanting this Nama. OM Namah Shivaya.
No, root means how the word is derived/arrived at, a linguistic feature of Sanskrit, other Indian languages. Sthirah means staying put, unchanging, Exist.
<br/>
<br/>

Here is a little exercise: Can we list examples of all things Sthira in this world? <br/>

Anandu: Air, water, fire ? <br/>

Aparna: Wood
<br/>
Somu: Facts/Truth.
<br/>

Panna: Can pancha bhutas  be an example of  Sthira
<br/>
Somu: Yes. Akasha, Vayu, Agni, Ap/Jala, Prithvi in that order. Anand did it partly. I guess you ae referring to the bhutas we see. It still is OK... More on that later down the Namavali... <br/>

Shobhi: Facts are straight forward whether we accept it or not is   'as it is'  but Truth is relative and prespective oriented. How can one say that it is sthira? <br/>

Shobhi: Water transforms into variety of forms and still returns to it's original form, that's a fact. It is as it is. On the other hand, imagine a jury situation, people might say things as he/she might observe it, perspectives differ the truth. <br/>

Shobhi: Truth tends to be what the person belives in. <br/>

Somu: Right. Truth as a technical term (Satya) means that which doesn't change. More like a fact. Hence shastra uses the term in the same sense. Simply put it is an objective usage. (Maybe too much for the younger one's). Shobhi's point made is in the subjective sense, I think. <br/>

Somu: For the uninitiated: Objective means just as the object is- as it is.. Subjective is what one (the subject) observes/interprets. <br/>

Somu: Other examples are The Sun, Moon in relation to us- the observer are also Sthirah. <br/>


Somu: Some more that are sthira: Dharma, Jnana, Vedas, Absolute time, These are the manifestations of the Supreme and hence are considered Sthira.
Also these are all objective.
<br/>

Panna: What is the absolute time.  ? <br/>

Somu: Time is defined & measured as the interval<br/>

Somu: ...between two events. So what is the reference  (to quantify, measure) for those two events? i.e<br/>

Somu: There must be an unchanging ref point to visualize any event & the interval, right? This unchanging aspect is absolute time.
Downtime
Yes. downtime can also be a reference, partly.
Reverting to  example of mud & pot, etc we see the pot is born, exists, lost. These are events in the absolute time of mud... Hope it's clear now...
<br/>
<br/>
Panna: So the example of pot the life of the pot is absolute time  ? <br/>

Somu: No the time of mud is absolute compared to the pot. Shifting your focus away from change...
Put urself in the position of the mud....
In fact, it is impossible to comprehend absolute time if you don't train yourself....
<br/>
Shobhi: Does it mean that the absolute time of mud is eternity?
<br/>
Yes (limited to the analogy)....😄
<br/>
Somu: OK. The next point is How Shiva alone is Sthirah?
All the listings so far, pertained to what we see, comprehend in the universe, jagat. Over time all these undergo  change.
Actually jagat means change. And all knowledge of jagat should also be classified as changing. How could that be?
Any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>

[Panna: Something like version 1 and Version  2<br/>

 Shubha Suresh: Before we move on, could you please explain subjective and objective again? Im stuck <br/>

<br/>
Sure. Objective or Subjective is all about the knowledge of a particular thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Somu: Another example. Let's define who Shubha is. Objectively she is a human being , a female of the species, etc. This doesn't change.
Subjectively to each one her relation is different. She is a daughter to somebody, a sister, a mother, a wife, etc..It changes.. Guess it must be clear. There are more intricacies but enough for now...
<br/>
<br/>

We see that the jagat is changing. Is it right to say that the knowledge of the jagat is also changing?
<br/>
Yes it is right. How?
<br/>
No. It is not. How? This is the dilemma.
<br/>
In order to solve this we must define what is jagat? What do we mean by it's knowledge? Right?
Only then we can arrive at an answer.
Now jagat is a complex system of innumerable objects. Amongst these, there are Causes- termed kaarana, and Effects- termed kaarya.
In our eg. The pots, tiles, bricks, etc are karyas-effects. Mud is the kaarana- Cause.
<br/>
 <br/>
The jagat is the system of this kaarana & it's  karyas. What is the activity we see in jagat?
What we see as activity is generally, the kaarya transforming into another or losing it's existence & merging into it's kaarana. Agreed?
So we can say that each karya is different to another, they all undergo change. This change/limitation of the karya- effects causes the change in the knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, knowledge follows the object. But if one's focus is on the kaarana- Cause,  the knowledge also remains unchanged.
<br/>
Shubha Suresh: I would assume so, we learn new things all the time.
I.e. karyas change, are limited from each other. The pot is not the brick, etc. & vice versa...
<br/>
Aparna: Hmm.. I would say energy can neither be created not destroyed. Likewise.. Knowledge exists,its just changing its form from one to another or expanding from one person to another.
<br/>
Somu: Now considering that the entire jagat is a karya....how?
OK, we explain that first... Look at this aspect of the karya-Effect. Any karya is born out of something, exists in that thing, and then merges/dissolves into that thing, it's kaarana. So what is the (this) kaarana of the Jagat? <br/>
<br/>

i.e. where was this vast & wonderful Jagat before it was born? Where does it go after dissolution?
<br/>
Obviously in it's kaarana-Cause... also known technically as the Moola kaarana....The eternal mystery that has baffled every thinker... & yet no one can comprehend it.
<br/>
It is the Paramatma, it's unchanging material cause, the Upaadaana kaarana. Hence He is called Sthirah........
<br/>
Well said...
<br/>
So far we have discussed the material aspect of the Cause of the jagat, pertaining to Sthirah.... we move on to the next Namam after your feedback/queries....

<br/>
Shubha Suresh: The soul is a karya, correct? What is its kaarana?
<br/>
Somu: Now, the soul is another entity in the conglomerate of the jagat. But it is neither a karya, nor have a kaarana. Very complicated to explain now. I have very deliberately avoided bringing it/him into perspective @ this juncture...
<br/>
Anyway a brief about the reason..... The challenge is- the jagat ,so far, was an objective aspect in the analysis. Once we include the soul into the discussion the perspective of the same jagat tends to be subjective, yet remain objective... A very complex situation for a beginner....😱😬😟
<br/>
But we get to deal with it a little later.. It would be more interesting...
<br/>
<br/>
Here we go Bindu...
Dhanurmasa is the last part of the Dakshinayana. It is the Devatas' early morning more like our Brahma muhurta. It is said in the Puranas like vishnu purana, etc. that the Devatas worship Srimannarayana during this period starting usually by the later part of Margashira masa up to Sankranti. Amidst this the Vaikunta Ekadashi also occurs. Since the onset of Uttarayana is near, all the Rishis also join the Devatas in worship of Lord Narayana. One who does the Vishnu puja in the early hours of these cold days would have the exclusive chance of worshipping the Lord along with the Rishis. He bathes with them in the sacred rivers, joins them in the worship of the Lord. Also light food is preferred during this period since metabolism is very low in this cold season. One is supposed to sleep less during this season in order to avoid bad health, so says Ayurveda. Guess that's it for now.,...


<br/><br/>

Summary of the 1st namam Sthirah. <br/>


Sthirah is one who stays put, Exists, is unchanging. Unchanging because He is the Kaarana/Cause for the ever changing Jagat. The analogy is like the clay kaarana of it's karyas pot, brick, tiles, etc. <br/>

The karyas transform, The kaarana stays put. That is we understand Unchanging. One who contemplates this aspect-nama of Ishvara will like the kaarana will find success in everything. OM Sthiraya Namah.

                           <p>Now we saw that all karyas are born, exist and dissolve in their kaarana. The furniture, dolls, etc are karyas of wood, ice, water, steam are karyas of H2O, etc,
<br/><br/>This feature of the Kaarana- not being destroyed is the 2nd nama Sthaanuh. Sthaanuh means immovable, unchanging. <br/>
The subtle difference between Sthirah & Sthaanuh is that Sthira is actually unchanging, Sthanu is base, stratum that is indestructible, facilitating all the karyas.
We see karanas themselves are innumerable. <br/>What is so special about Ishvara?
Well, He is the Kaarana of such innumerable Jagats. The Lalita sahasranama says - He can never be destroyed. How? We will see that later on.... <br/><br/>
A query: <br/>
We in this Jagat also are watching everything change, destroyed in the Jagat. We are also Sthaanu? <br/>
Being the observer We are also unchanging? Why Ishvara alone is Sthaanuh?
Now look at this: <br/>
1. We ourselves know/say we are born, we too are lost over time. <br/><br/>
2. Also we do not see the entire Jagat born out of us, exist in us, dissolved into us. How can you be Sthirah /Sthanuh? <br/>
In fact  nothing in the Jagat is different from Ishvara & hence He is Sthanuh. <br/><br/>

                              <p> We now proceed to the 3rd Nama 'Prabhuh'. Prabhuh means The one who rules.
Lord Shiva being the Supreme rules over the Jagat- consisting of both  animate & inanimate.<br/><br/>
A little background info now...
This vast Jagat can be classified into 3 categories.. The inert (inanimate) Jagat, The jivas (souls), Ishvara. Paramatma.
The Jagat is inert, limited &  prone to change. So it is a Karya as we saw earlier.
Now Jiva/soul , i.e myself is an active entity. How? Everyone says I think, I eat, I run,, etc. Also w.r.t his/ her gross body one says I am strong, I am tall, I am fair, etc..W.r.t the subtle body one says I am intelligent, I am happy, I can remember well, etc. Thus the jiva is proved to be not inert.
The 3rd entity is Paramatma/God. We by ourselves do not know about his existence, but believe in Him by trust in the words of scriptures, parents, preceptors, etc.
His existence  as an active entity is proved easily by enquiry in to the creation of this world. Maybe a person can create a mobile phone, an atom bomb, an airplane, etc. But who created the raw material for all these inventions, who created the rivers, mountains, oceans, etc....obviously a super being far more intelligent & capable.
In short God can be defined as One who is responsible & capable for which we are not responsible or capable of (definition from Swami Paramanada Bharati ji).
Thus with a little more inquiry & reasoning we see that God is far superior to the other two entities. He is a super-set of the other two (jiva & Jagat) which is the matter on hand.
We will take to it next....based on Shastra & inquiry.
<br/><br/>
Continuing our discussion on Shiva sahasranama...
Let's revert to the qualities of the jiva for a better understanding. We saw the jiva has a gross body & a subtle body. When we refer to jiva here, it is useful to realise/take Jiva as myself.
The gross body called sthoola shareera is the outer motor & sense organs, so also other anatomy of the individual. The subtle body called sookshma sharira consists of the motor & sense faculties, the mind quartet- mind, intellect, memory & ego, the 5 life forces.
Remember, the subtle-sookshma sharira is the invisible driving force of the gross body.
The discussion gets tougher & more interesting now on.<br/><br/>
The sthoola sharira essentially is- the speech, hands,  feet/legs, the two excretory organs- the motor organs; the eyes, ears, tongue, nose & skin- the sense organs, etc.
The gross & subtle bodies together facilitate  all the activity (both external & internal) of the individual.<br/><br/>
In each jiva these aspects work to their limits as destined by his/her karma. This now sets the preamble to all future discussions. Also each of these aspects are controlled by individual Devatas also in accordance to his karma. These Devatas exist as Manasa Shariras- similar to the Jiva's subtle/sookshma body. But these Karma Devatas as they can be referred to, are highly evolved beings with wonderful capacities, capable of taking/appearing in any form as they desire.
These Devatas also reside in the respective parts of the individual's body (their office) & witness/administer the phala of the jiva starting at birth till the end. It is a long discussion to explain this part of philosophy. Let's deal with it sometime later.
The phala is administered wrt the jiva's previous & the impact of his present karma along with dependent factors like environment, other individuals, freewill, etc.
<br/><br/>Thus the Devatas are also Jivas performing their bounden duties till their tenure in the Jagat ends, usually the Manvantara, a measure of time. Now we come to the crux of the point-
Paramatma/Ishvara is over & above these overseeing all these activities to it's logical completion of every jiva, an unimaginably complicated process.
Here on we can get to see why He is Prabhuh- the King....
<br/><br/><b>
You mean to say that every  of the devatas take ownership of some organs in the sthoola sharira ? </b> <br/><br/>
Right. Each organ has a Abhimani/designated Devata for it's function. So they do their duty as long as the Jiva's karma is not expended. Thereon they fall silent. The Abhimani Devatas exist & reside for functioning of sookshma
Sharira also.<br/><br/> For eg. Shiva/Rudra is the Abhimani devata for ego, resides in the heart. That is why a person touches/refers to his heart when an action related to ego occurs. When I say I, I touch my heart involuntarily. Were you taught do so? Just think?
Similarly Indra, the king of Devatas is Abhimani for strength, He resides in the shoulders. All strength related actions are rooted in the shoulders, hence the usage giving a shoulder, right?

                            <h2>'OM bhiimaaya namah'</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                           <!--  <img src="img/portfolio/circus.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> -->
                              <p> <br/>The word Bheema is derived from Bhee- bhaya, frightening. So He is Bheema- bhaya kaaraka. It also  implies that He is bhaya naashana. Taittiriya samhita, a part of Krishna yajurveda beautifully describes Rudra thus- ghoraanyaa shivaanyaa rudrasya tanooh meaning The Lord Rudra has the unique form of being both ferocious & solacious at the same time. Reminds us of nama Bhayakrud Bhayanaashanah of Vishnu sahasranama. The Taittiriya upanishad also says- Bheeshaasmaad vaatah pavate. Bheeshodeti Suryah. ...agnischendrascha. Mrutyur dhaavati panchama iti- it means Vayu (devata) blows because of His fear, Sun rises & sets because of fear. So do Agni, Indra. So does the 5th Mrityu run. This should give a fair idea of His prowess.
<br/><br/><br/>
Question: So that means all the gods fear Shiva, and that is why they do what they have to.  <br/>
What exactly is ether/akasha?
<br/><br/>
Also, it is Shiva's energy that flows through each devatha, so why should they fear him? How can he control the karyas? In the example of mud and pot, the pot may have the property of mud, but mud can't control or harm the pot until the pot is destroyed...isn't that true? <br/><br/>
Ans: You got it right. <br/><br/>
Here Shiva is taken as Paramatman/Supreme himself in this nama. (There is a very subtle but important difference in the two, won't cover that now). Fearsomeness of Shiva is in regard to His uncompromising steadfastness to Dharma in it's completeness. (no one word to define Dharma). This percolates to the Devatas who are again highly evolved Jivas who will have strived for these positions over billions of rebirths. Obviously they are very passionate to their positions, yet they are aware of the supremacy of Paramatman. So they actually fear any drift of Dharma & it's consequences on the entire system, countless jivas for ages to come. Puranas are replete with such examples as you know. <br/><br/>

Now Devatas are, in fact,  competitive positions attained by Jivas. These Jivas are born as Devatas who in turn oversee/control the proper functioning of the universe till dissolution. It is a heirarchical system with us on the lower end. <br/><br/>

Now that said, we briefly discuss ur query about karyas/effects. Let's consider this aspect of Cause & Effect. (I am reluctant at this point, but ur query wormed it out). 
Any change in the Effect/pot doesn"'t affect/effect the Cause/clay. If the pot is smashed, drilled, etc there is change to/in the mudness (!!??) of the clay. But any qualitative change of clay (like colour, dampness, retentivity, etc affects/effects all the pots, tiles, etc- karyas. Right. Similarly if the pot (by that we mean the shaped mud/clay) is destroyed the mud exists. We remove the mud/clay where is the pot/Effect?... Guess  I have explained ur query well. Now for the answer.. <br/><br/>

In case of Devatas & Paramatma Shiva we learnt that Shiva's energy flows in the Devatas too. Similar to electricity doing all the work in the heater, cooler, etc. Yet the Devatas (remember we used the word Abhimani earlier) by virtue of their karma/position (heater, cooler) are separated (perhaps egotistically) from the truly indivisible energy. That is the Jivatva- jivaness. <br/><br/>

Our status is a lot worse than that, in a way. A lot of this will be dealt with in future Namas too. Summarily, we say it is Jivas prerogative to sense that activity- Vyavahaara is based on the karyas/Effects as against the Kaarana/Cause. <br/><br/>

Our sincere prayers to Lord Shiva, so we all shall be able to transcend the vyavahaarya jagat and unify into Him once & for all. Namah Shivaya. <br/><br/>
Let us consider this point also. In the case of the mud & pot both karyas & kaarana are inert. But for jagat Shiva is a live & active kaarana. Naturally He is most powerful & in absolute control. Also He is detached from everything since they are all not different from him. A big difference separating him from other Jivas. <br/><br/>
Akaasha is that which provides space for everything to exist & act. Very different from our definition of  outer space. <br/><br/>

All these meanings ate attributed to Lord Shiva in the next Namaste. Now Pravarah is defined as prakarshena varah especially the Best. Although He is all powerful being the Moola kaarana for everything. <br/><br/>He doesn't have any unfulfilled wishes, desires. He is therefore free from all limitations which makes Him the best, prakarshena varaneeyah- especially respectable. That is Pravarah.

                              <p> The 7th Nama Varah describes Him as all encompassing. Shiva is the Cause of all animate & inanimate things in the jagat, He being the Upaadaana karana. He also is known as the Nimitta kaarana- the facilitating Cause for the jagat. Usually the Upaadaana & Nimitta karanas are different from each other as we know. For eg. Clay & Potter; Gold & goldsmith, Cotton & weaver, etc. But now Shiva is the sole Kaarana for the jagat. He also resides in every being as the all pervasive Self, This distinctive quality is described as Varah. <br/> <br/>

Now for a small exercise. Can you list some examples of an entity that is both Upaadaana & Nimitta kaarana? <br/>
Panna: Lord Brahma<br/>
Best example would be  mother. <br/>
Quite close, but with a little caveat.... She doesn't have the knowledge of the anatomy, much less the science of it. <br/><br/>

OK. I will explain a little more.  Upaadaana kaarana is that material cause from which it's objects/shapes/effects manifest, exist in & merge into. Usually it is inert. A Nimitta kaarana is that intelligent cause which has the knowledge/mastery to bring out the effect. So it has to be a living being with basic intelligence to do so. Take a relook at the examples above. It would be clear.... <br/><br/>
You are asking for an example where the creator and the thing they create are the same? <br/><br/>

In the mud-potter etc. examples mud is different from the potter. But both are Causes. However potter takes control of mud/ has the intellect to shape the pot. The pot originates from clay/mud, exists in/as clay, merges into clay- upaadaana/material cause. The potter is the intellect to form it. My query is: Quote an example where the material cause & the intellectual cause are one & the same, i.e where the shapes originate & merge into the intellectual cause itself. Jagat originates & dissolves into Paramatman who also is the intel/nimitta cause. <br/><br/>

Now, Can there be another such entity which is both the material & intell Cause?
Water? Is that an example? <br/><br/>
Water-H2O, Hydrogen & Oxygen atoms are all inert-jada- ??.
Somu: Ok. Here is a hint- it belongs to the insect world....
Silk worm<br/><br/>
The silk worm weaves it's coccoon from it's own saliva, enclosed till it becomes a moth with the innermost layer of the coccoon forming it's skin, etc.

                            <h2>'OM Varah namah'</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>
                                With respect to the Naama 'Sarvaatma' we have briefly discussed the characteristics and relation of all 3 entities in tha world, viz. Jagat, Jiva & Brahma/Ishvara (not to be mistaken with Brahmaa- the Creator). It is evident to a keen mind that all these entities are very different to each other in characteristics & functions. At the outset there are a few similarities owing to the above relation but essentially there seem to be no common attributes or features. For example, we see that Jagat &  Ishvara have the Cause-Effect relation & are not different; yet from their functions they are different. Then Jiva & Jagat being interdependent for all functionality, are bound to be entirely different. Thereafter Jiva & Ishvara are similar in some attributes but differ in capabilities. In fact, it is observed that no activity can occur if there are no differences at all. For eg. for energy to flow there is a need for two different potentials- one high & one low. Therefore it is quite confusing for anybody to arrive at a clear understanding to the meaning of this Nama. In other words, we see that all the three relations have a few commonalities but differ in several other aspects. This essentially leads us to deliberate upon the differences & reconcile the purport of the Nama. </br></br>

                                Having summarised thus we now take upon how to realise that/arrive at Ishvara is the Atma of everything- Sarvaatma,  i.e. how is Ishvara the Atma/essence of the Jagat &  how He is the Atma of all Jivas with the help of Shastra, logic/inference, experience.
                                Let us consider the most basic feature of any object animate or otherwise. What could that be? What is the most common feature of everything? </br></br>

                                Thinking hard one can say- the reference 'It'. All knowledge & activity is based upon this ubiquitous (all prevalent) understanding. In fact, it is almost never questioned, it is taken for granted. </br>
                                For eg. all objects are referred to in this manner: "This is a ball", "This is a cow", "It is a horse", "It is technology", "It is science", etc, etc. Further people also are referred to as "This/He is Rama", "This/She is Sita", "This/it is a girl", "This/it is a boy", etc. The common forms in all such statements are "this", "that", "it", "He", "She", "is", etc. Further analysing this usage, everybody refers to himself/herself/itself as "I". For eg. "I walk", "I talk", etc. </br></br>

                                Now  these references "I", "It" are common to all, irrespective of form or gender, generally coupled with activity or an adjective- "I am this, I am that". The etymology of these words mean "to be". How did this happen? Who taught us this? What is the origin of this understanding/usage? </br></br>

                                Ever wonder how all objects can be defined with a simple "It"? How can everybody, inspite of their various activities & differences designate/reference themselves to a simple "I"? How is it so universal to all objects & beings? </br></br>

                                Isn't this "I" the inherent feature of Atma/myself? In this Everybody's experience is the same- that "I exist"; That is the Origin. Therefore HE/This "I" (bereft of all references/adjectives) is Sarvaatma. If 'It' is not the same Atma in one & all such a knowledge cannot be universal. </br></br>

                                We as an intelligent species, should pause & start/learn to wonder at these seemingly small things in life. It gives us a direction to our path of achievement far from our individualistic attitudes, isn't it?  It certainly will lead to a more successful, harmonious & peaceful society.... The Mahabharata. </br></br>
                                This identification of the commonness in all objects & beings i.e Ishvara is the essence of (Atma) of everything, is the Advaita jnana propounded by Acharya Shankara, as taught in the Vedas & Upanishats. One who strives & realises this knowledge will surely be at Peace forever, will attain the Supreme. This is the Atma Svarupa. This is the Path to Moksha. </br></br>

                                Let us refer to a few statements from the Vedas in this context. The Ishavasya says: 'yastu sarvaani bhootaani atmani eva anupashyati, sarvabhootheshu ca aatmaanam, tato na vijugupsate' meaning The one who sees all the bhootas(forms) in the Atma itself (in Himself); The Atma (Himself) in all the bhootas (forms) then he will transcend the feeling of sadness/remorse. Lord Yama teaches Nachiketas 'Bhidyate hrdaya granthih, chidyante sarva samshayaah, ksheeyante chaasya karmaani tasmin drshte paraavarey' meaning the buddhi (hrdaya) gets unentangled; all doubts, inconsistencies are eliminated, all his karma are destroyed for the one who (learned to) 'see' the Supreme Sthaana of the Atma. Rigveda says ' Tad Vishnoh paramam padam sadaa pashyanti soorayah' meaning The learned see/have in sight that Vishnu's Supreme position always...The Upanishat preaches 'Atmaavaa arey drashtavyah shrothavyo mantavyo nididhidhyasitavyah' meaning Hey This Atma is to be identified/seen, learnt from teaching/hearing, diiscussed/deliberated upon and later assimilated; 'Yo veda nihitam guhayaam parame vyoman. Sah ashnute sarvaan kamaanthsah' meaning He who learns about the One residing in this sacred space of the intellect (guha), will attain all desires alongwith (Jnana). There are innumerable such teachings in the shastras emphasising this Atma is one & the same in all- Sarvaatma.. The famous Rudra prashna is all about this- 'Prostrations to the Ishvara who is the chariot, the charioteer, the sick, the healthy, the sannyasi, the hunter, etc, etc. </br></br>

                                Question: From the above quotes, the Shastra seems to suggest that this Sarvaatmatva is an experience- 'Tasmin drshte paraavarey', 'Sadaa pashyanti soorayah', 'Atmanyeva anupashyati', etc. Do we find it in our experience that I am non-different from everything? Is it really possible? Can you please explain? </br></br>

                                Ans: Indeed it is a very good question. Although here we are trying to see how/why Ishvara is Sarvaatma, since the Shastras (Vedas, Puranas) suggest that this Sarvaatmatva is Moksha, this experience is a matter/necessity of the Jivas. That means every Jiva should identify his chaste/pure form & realise the path of Moksha- redemption from the cycle of rebirths. </br></br>

                                Now we analyse our own experience as follows: Everyone when asked who he/she is, introduces him/herself as such & such a person with a name, relates him/herself to another individual as his/her father, mother, friend, etc. He relates to what he does & introduces himself as an engineer, doctor, etc. Queried further, introspecting he/she would point to the body say he/she is tall, fair, fat, thin, etc. With further enquiry he identifies himself with the more subtle senses, mind, intellect, ego, etc and introduces himself integral of all these faculties as an intellectual, dullard, yogi, etc. This is not entirely correct as demonstrated now: By feeling a touch on any part of his body one says somebody touches him. However when one is in pain, asked, one points to the corresponding limb saying here, separating himself from that part of the body. When one performs a feat and succeeds one says he/she has achieved it. If unsuccessful he blames some faculty of his, separating himself from it, citing loss of concentration (blaming the mind), lack of control in the limbs, lack of visibility (blaming the senses), etc, etc., yet maintaining an air that he/she is capable of it. At least this shows one's very common  mistake of understanding. This separation is more profound in his sleep (called Swapna) where his body is at rest, either on a nice cosy bed or on a heap of pebbles. His experience of running, flying, jumping, etc, still is very vivid all the same. He expresses joy, sorrow, etc. from all these experiences of sleep, perhaps much more than in the wakeful state. He cannot respond to any sound, touch, etc. that may have occurred. (Sometimes even in his wakeful state, if he is deeply engrossed in an activity). Obviously one is not the gross body & senses. He also wakes up from a nightmare & feels relieved that it is not reality and perhaps, thanks his stars too!!! Obviously he must be different from his body. Similarly in his deep-sleep (called Sushupthi) apart from not responding to any of the external factors, one doesn't even know of or remember anything. That is because even the mind is at rest. The only facts one can relate is He existed even then, and experienced pure bliss. Ask any living being- the answer is the same. The mosquito won't fly away, the deer won't run away. Involuntarily a grieving mother would be oblivious of resting on the body of her departed infant..... .!!!! Such is the extent of natural craving for the happiness from this state of deep-sleep..... The Oneness in Ishvara...... The Brihadaaranyaka says: 'Kumaro va, Maharajo va Maha Brahmano va athighneem anandasya gatva shayeeta' meaning whether he is a small kid, A great king or a great Brahmin/Yogi he enters this ultimate negator of sorrow-The happiness and sleeps.... This stae is termed Abhaya- negator of fear.... </br></br></br>

                                Another eg. in the wakeful state one has to explain who he is, how he is related, for others to know. One has to relate his dreams to a doctor/psychologist to help treat him. It is a mystery how anyone understands, without the need for an explanation, when one says he/she slept/rested well......!!! There are no further questions.... </br></br></br>

                                Now the Shruti/Shastra raises this question: Who are you? ...... Then answers in brief- Truly you are not different from that Ishvara/Paramatma. Therefore It is the experience of the Oneness with Paramatma bestowed by Him- His wonderful grace upon everyone, everyday!!!!  Moksha is still a long way from Here. Alas we conveniently shrug off & continue in our indulgences.

                            <h2>'OM Sarvavikhyaatah namah'</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>
                                Now we move on to the rest of the related namas of this stanza. 'Sarvavikhyaatah' meaning Well-known to all. How is it that Ishvara is well known to all? Just as we saw in the preceding discussion, every common being in his wakeful state likens himself to the gross body- Sharira, senses- Indriyas, faculties quartet- Antahkarana and moves about catering to the desires depndent on them. Since the body, senses are the grosser aspects they have a limited strength and finally like a bird that flew around all day returns exhausted to it's nest, he returns to the realms of his antahkarana where all the senses go to rest. This is his Swapna where all the senses retract from their positions in the gross body and become one in the manas (in short for manas, buddhi, chitta, ahankara) whose sthana- position is the heart. In his wakeful state he (Jiva) dwells/works in the face; the reason why the head droops down when one dozes off !!! </br></br>

                                Here the jiva continues his activity through his manas creating a virtual body & senses to satisfy his whims totally unbridled creating his own world. However the universe he experiences there, are based on facts from his wakeful state. 'Atha rathaan rathayogaan pathah srjate'- he creates the chariots, the charioteers, the routes too just as in the outside world, says the upanishat. Here also he is engrossed in his experiences oblivious of his true self. After a long time in this activity the manas also exhausted, falls silent. The jiva hereafter is (forcefully) rescinded by Ishvara to no activity & all One in His True self. The only defects here are that it is limited in time, not forever and Jiva doesn't know he is One with Paramatma. </br></br>
                                Why? Try answering it.... </br></br>

                                Thus, every being experiences the Ananda of his true self being in Oneness with Paramatma (although he doesn't realise it, unless told- now you all do !!) everyday. This experience is universal & every normal being feels understanding it, unless one is encumbered by mahapaapa. </br></br></br>

                                Therefore Paramatma is ever well-known in this sense. However great effort is required to experience the same in our wakeful state- Jaagrat. That is the essence of sadhana....?!! All of us vociferously search for Him in the external objects He so endearingly  has maifested Himself into, but fail to realise He resides in our own heart as Myself.....?? Antarmukha samaaraadhyaa bahir mukha sudurlabha- She is  so well propitiated inward yet so difficult to find outside of it...!!!! says the ever beautiful Lalita sahasranama......This way Ishvara is 'Sarvavikhyatah'. </br></br></br>

                                Looking further in the 1st stanza, we are to describe the 2 namas 'Sarvah' & 'Sarvakarah'. </br></br>

                                We have seen that Shiva is sarvaatma i.e the quintessence/atma of everything- 'sarvasya atma' &  therefore known to all- ‘Sarva vikhyaatah, through their experience of sushupti/deep-sleep. So also, the Lalita sahasranama describes this as ‘aabaala gopa viditaa’- meaning even children & cowherds (no racism intended) know Her.

                                Now Lord Krishna describes Him as Sarvah- meaning He is everything, just analogus to saying the spider is the web. The Purusha sukta also describes this aspect as 'Naamaani kritva-abhivadan yadaaste- meaning He creates everything and calls out each by it's name. That is, He manifests as everything- Rupa/shapes, then names each of them- Nama.

                            <h2>'OM Sarvakarah namah'</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>
                                Therefore all His creation is generally referred to as Namarupa. So He is 'Sarvakarah'- One who creates everything. This dispels any thoughts of the Creator being different from the Creation. </br></br>

                                At the outset, both sarvaatma & sarvah seem to mean one & the same. Of course, it is so. However the subtle difference is in the perspective of the student/sadhaka. Let me explain. When we say He is atma of everything- sarvaatma, the focus of the  beginner shifts on to Him- Ishvara, the inward shift towards Atma. When described as Sarvah the focus is on the inevitable activity with/in outward jagat but reminding the sadhaka that the jagat- Namarupas are Ishvara's manifestations; The purpose being the focus back on Ishvara. I might be looking at the web but I actually understand/see the spider- helping the beginners/students' perspective. The other- sarvah, is the baffled sadhakas' perspective.  Therefore, we could also see the true purport of the forgone discussion of subjective & objective understanding. </br></br>

                                As an example for better understanding lets take the example of arithmetic. In just how many ways can 100 mangoes be counted? Applying rules of math like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc., methods are many- like grouping, counting, etc. The methods used are subjective, the final count of 100 mangoes to be matched/arrived at is objective. Similarly beginning with examples from Jagat being the easiest way for a beginner, Ishvara is Sarvasya Atma. Once identified He is everything; negating the thought of anything different from him. </br></br>

                                Saint Thyagaraja earnestly pleads thus: 'Oh One who is everything - all that moves & also all that does not,  I very painstakingly inquired 'in Here' and understood that You are everything. Having seen(understood) You well, why do I need anything else that is other than You, Oh Raghava, Why do you have to hide from us- .....marugela charaachara rupa.... anni neevanuchu antarangamuna tinnaga vedaki telusu kontinayya, ninne gaani matinenna jaalanorula....'</br></br></br>

                                The great Purandara dasa in simpler & more direct terms says- Kereya neeranu kerege chelli varava padedavarante kaaniro.....Hari samarpane maadi badukiro.......Elsewhere he makes trivial of our living saying- bindige odedare onde kaasu.....taare bindigeya- give this life to that Ocean of Bliss.... </br></br>
                                Need we say more?  I guess this gives us a focus of how we need to shape our lives now & here & henceforth... </br></br>

                                The next nama Bhavah means 'to manifest' thus summarising all the other namas of this stanza. It is to emphasise that all things are born from Him, exist & dissolve in to Him. Ishvara is the ultimate cause. The Rudra prashna says 'Namo Bhavaaya ca Rudraaya ca' meaning Salutations to the one who manifests- causing happiness; Salutations to the One who unmanifests- causing grief.  Rudra means One who causes others to cry; Rud- to cry; dra- one who causes....
                                </br></br>Summarising the Namas from the 1st stanza we read Lord Krishna describing Ishvara/Shiva/Paramatma as the Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer of the worlds- Jagat. The Jagat being termed as Namarupas- name forms, is the Effect- Karya of the  Cause- Kaarana i.e Ishvara. The analogies of clay & pot, etc.,, Gold & ornaments, The spider & it's web all make it much easier to identify this aspect of Ishvara. Thus it is also understood that Ishvara is therefore Sarvaatma-quintessence/soul of everything in the Jagat, as also everything- the inanimate/Jada jagat as well as the Jivas, are all Himself- Sarvah. This can be identified by the experience of unbridled Ananda in Sushupti-deep sleep. In this state everyone's experience of Ananda is the same since all are One in their true form- Svarupa which is Ishvara Himself. </br></br></br>

                                The 2nd stanza describes Shiva's other Rupas/forms for His upaasana by the Sadhaka. The Shiva purana emphasizes the fact that for those of us who cannot contemplate upon His subtle forms/aspects the procedure of Puja/Upasana is the way forward. Eventually we will attain that Oneness in Him. The Gita also says the same: ....Jnana yogena Sankhyanam Karma yogena Yoginam- meaning there are two levels of sadhana to attain me The practice of knowledge is the one for Jnanis (who are way ahead)  Sankhyas; the second being the path of (relevant Vaidika) karma for the Yogis/likes of us. Same is repeated so by Bhagavan Krishna when he says 'aarudhasya tasyaiva shamah kaaranam uchyate' meaning the One who has practised (karma) well- the aarudha is advised shama- the practice of controlling the senses & mind (meditation).  Hence His grosser forms are described for the benefit of lesser mortals like us.

A metaphorical but real description to explain His Omnipresence.

                            <p>
                                Prabhuh is - He (Ishvara) is the Soul & Shakti of all the Jivas.  Jivas experience the fruits of their own Karma. So in that sense it is Ishvara who encompasses the action & results of Karma. Prakarshena Bhunkte iti Prabhuh. Note that this & the 3rd nama, although same, differ in their meanings. </br></br>

                                We now come to the end of the 2  stanza covering 21 namas. Any discussions & elaborations for the points covered are welcome. </br></br>

                                A query from our member: </br></br>
                                When Lord Shiva is a creator sustainer and also destroyer.  Why is He still called just a destroyer? </br></br>
                                Ans: Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma (4 faced) are all one & the same in terms of their Svarupa meaning They all have the same powers. In fact, Ganesha, Shakti, Surya also are equal in powers & described so. In this sense, They are all contemplated upon, propitiated (pooja done to) so. </br></br>

                                But in their designated powers- Rupas/forms they donot transgress the others' capacities/functions. Similar to an organization’s structure. The structure roots from there, in fact. It is also very easy for commoners like us to base our needs, understand the different aspects of Dharma & functionality of the world clearly, with them as the reference. </br></br>

                                However, technically speaking Brahma's position is a little weird; Too complicated for anybody. I will let it rest. Therefore Shastras tend to use the words Shiva, Vishnu, etc. when discussion is about functions pertaining to the Jagat. It uses the word Ishvara to discussions pertaining to higher functions like Creation, etc., & Tattva- True aspects/Svarupa/Atma. For eg. when we talk of Sarvaatma He is to be referred to as Ishvara. When we talk about His descriptive form He is Shiva, Vishnu, etc.

                                Pravrittih - Prakarshena kurvadrupataya vartanam Pravrittih is the definition. It means That which exists/remains (vartanam) Especially/emphatically (prakarshena)  as the nearest Cause that effects any action (kurvadrupa). In simple words It is the main cause for action i.e The reason that initiates any action.
                                For eg. an advertisement instigates the desire to checkout/acquire a product; a whiplash initiates action in the bullocks. The cry of the infant spurs action in the mother, etc. In Ishvara, as we are already aware, the Pravritti is that of Creation, Sustenance & Destruction of the Jagat. The Samaveda states 'Tajjalaan iti Shanta Upaseeta' meaning Meditate upon Him as the Ever Peaceful & from Whom it (jagat) emanates, disintegrates into and exists in. The Taiitiriya & Chandogya say 'So akamayata, bahusyaam prajaayeya' meaning He (Ishvara) desired thus, ' I shall be born & become many'. </br>
                                </br>

                                What is the action seen in Lord Shiva? </br></br>

                                Apart from the Creation triad, Lord Shiva also oversees the Sthiti- management of the Jagat during it's existence. His actions of Anugraha & Nigraha- Bestowance & Retribution based upon Dharma are all His prowesses which He executes effortlessly. He also manifests as different Avataras for the benefit of the Jivas & provide solace & guidance in the path of Dharma & Salvation apart from saving the worlds from degeneration from time to time. </br></br>


                                What is the Cause that instigates such action? </br></br>
                                So it is obvious that all these complex activities are performed by the Lord in order to meet the needs of the infinite Jivas in accordance to their previous & present Karma within the framework of Dharma. It means that Ishvara's Pravritti is based on the Jivas' Karma. How is that possible? A parallel can be drawn to explain this: Just as a father makes/builds a toy for his crying child, Ishvara fulfils the Jivas' desires in the ways mentioned above. </br></br>

                                Wish to add a note for the sake of clarity: Many people use the argument that The acts of Creation & Delusion, etc. are the God's leela- mirth. It would be wrong to construe that God derives pleasure from/enjoys the discomfiture of His own children/subjects, isn't it? Also the word Leela is also used in the sense  'effortless'. I leave it to your discretion to deliberate upon the point. </br></br>

                                However it is true that Ishvara has nothing to achieve from all these activities since He is an Aptakaama (Fulfiled desires). He clearly states that in the Bhagavadgita more than once.

                            <h2>OM Nivritti namaH </h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>
                                Being an Aaptakaama, Shiva has no desires to be fulfilled & is unassociated to any Pravritti. However the karma of ours- Jivas triggers actions in not only us but also in Ishvara, Who otherwise would be in complete serenity, a funny situation of sorts. (Ishvara has to see through the entire process of Creation, etc. in order to fulfil even a single desire of the Jiva). Therefore Shiva is truly of the form Nivritti-'Nikarshena nirudyamatayaa vartanam'. This is His true form- Svarupa.</br></br>

                                Another point of explanation is also relevant here. In the framework of Sanatana Dharma there are two paths Pravritti marga & Nivritti marga (B.Gita introduction); also defined as Preyo marga & Shreyo marga (Kathopanishat) respectively. The Pravritti marga consists of all relevant activities within the framework of Dharma for the benefit of all the Jivas. This is framed by Bhagavan Himself so that every Jiva can fulfil his desires & achievements by adhering to & performing their respective stipulated karma. This is borne & propagated by the first born Rishis known as Prajapatis. They are intelectually highly evolved & are born at the beginning of each Creation. Unlike us, they can remember their learnings from previous births in bygone Creations  and are Swayambhus (not born of any parents). They simply occur on the earth and continue with the formulation &  propagation of Dharma, etc. Swayambhuva Manu, Vasishtha, Atri, Pulastya & many others belong to this Path. </br></br>

                                On the other hand there are Rishis Sanatkumaras- Sanaka, Sananandana, Sanatana, Sanatsujata- who renounce the worlds & karmas as soon as they are born & propagate the path of renunciation & Salvation. </br></br>

                                They are all immensely well versed in the sciences of the worlds, Dharma & Jnana (almost equal to that of Ishvara); Have tapasya & absolutely blemishless abilities so profound that the Mahabharata advises us to chant & remember their names every morning (Praatasmaraneeyas) if anyone wishes for progress in this life. </br></br>

                                Now Ishvara (Shiva) is the Atma of all these Rishis as much as He is ours. It sounds very strange that Shiva is described both as One brimming in activity (Pravritta) and a renunciate (Nivritta) at the same time. This is indeed a very tough aspect to comprehend. However it can be explained as follows: </br></br>
                                The purposes of a needle, an axe, an anvil are all different. The benefits & afflictions are limited to their forms, so to say. Their cause-the iron being different from all these forms has no such afflictions.  Supposing that the iron is bent, blunt or broken is only denominative (purposeful) to it's forms, iron is said to be unaffected & beyond all this in it's true form. </br></br>

                                We Jivas in our wakeful states/rupas/faculties are all different. But we see that in our deep sleep/svarupa we leave behind  all our differences & experience the same Oneness & Ananda. It follows that we are certainly different & beyond all of this in our true form. Isn't it true that administerd anaesthesia, one wouldn't feel a thing even if he is hammered, drilled & operated upon (God forbid such a thing). Shantam paapam.
                                Similarly, although Ishvara is a Pravritta or Nivritta in his Vishwaroopa Vaishvanaratma form He is really beyond all of it in all Serenity- 'Shantam Shivam Advaitam Chaturtham Manyante Sa Atma sa vijneyah'. </br></br>

                            <h2>OM Niyatah namaH </h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>
                                Therefore He is described as Niyatah- One who has rescinded all his faculties; Shiva is the foremost amongst all renunciates. He shines in His true form untouched of- of any Paapa says the Veda- 'Yaa tey Rudra Shivaa tanooraghoraa apaapakashinee...'</br></br>

                                Even amongst Jivas it is only possible for one without paapa to truly transcend the bonds of samsara. This is because an iota of desire would somehow germinate into karma which in turn binds & drives one into the cycle of rebirths. Not only that.  All actions in the beings are instigated by the indriyas & other faculties listed earlier on- which are themselves activated by desire- Kama. Therefore one who desires to attain the Supreme Shiva has to learn controlling his Indriyas & Karanas. This is explained with a very beautiful analogy in the Kathopanishat.  'Atmaanam rathinam viddhi shariram rathameva tu| Buddhim tu saarathim viddhi manah pragrahameva ca| Indriyani hayaan aahuh vishayans-teshu gocharaan| Atmendriya mano yuktah bhoktaa ityaahuh maneeshinah|' meaning (Lord Yama tells Nachiketas) The Learned say so- Think of yourself (Jiva) as the weary traveller in the chariot, this body being that chariot; Buddhi (intellect) is the charioteer (driving it), the mind is the reins steering it ( the chariot); The Indriyas (karmendriyas & jnanendriyas) are the horses pulling it, the vishayas- objects (& desires) of the worlds are towards which the horses are running forth; Thus this Atma  enjoined with the indriyas & manas (karanas) is termed the Bhoktaa (Jnaataa, Kartaa also) by the Intellectuals. </br></br>

                                Even to achieve defectless Phalas (results) pertaining to the worlds (Punya) & avoid Paapa one has to have a tremendous amount of alertness & faultless control over the Indriyas, etc. achieved thru Dharma. This has been demonstrated in the examples of Raavana, Hiranyakashipu etc. Asuras; history of many Devas; more evidently in us manushyas. The puranas & histories like Ramayana, Bhaarata are replete with examples & technics to guide us. Therefore, Ishvara is the sole Guru who can guide us in this path, He Himself being the greatest Ascetic. Therefore He is the Real Niyatah residing in all of us. May His grace guide us in the path of Dharma & into Jnana.

                                Dhruvah- Fixed, stationary. 'Yasmaat achalam tasmaat drudham, dhruvam ityarthah' explains Acharya Shankara in the Gita meaning since He is unmoving He is firm meaning Fixed. This is analogus to the Pole star (Dhruva nakshatra) being the reference to find directions in the world. Similarly Lord Shiva is central to all activities of the worlds.
                                </br></br>
                                The term Dhruva is also understood in the following sense: wherein the spokes of the wheel bind the rim to the axis and the wheel rotates relative to the stationary axis; wherein an absolute co-ordinate is fixed as the origin for all relative & absolute measurements; The metric weight remains fixed relative to all other weighed objects & so forth. In all these measurements- relative or absolute, the reference is always assumed fixed however arbitrary i.e for any measurement to happen the reference has to be & is Dhruva- unmovable.

                                Shmashaanavaasee: Shaanah is where one is finally laid to rest; shma is from where there is no return/one never rises again meaning the cemetry. Lord Shiva dwells here & hence called Shmashaanavasee. In the gross sense it is a description of Lord Shiva's abode in Varanasi as described in the Shiva purana. However the Jiva who with Realisation of his true Self totally surrenders everything- his gross & subtle bodies, the karanas, his karma- to the Lord will never return nor will be reborn. This realisation is of the form in which there is no distinction between Jiva & Brahman termed Brahmatmaikatva in the Shastras. This Brahmatmaikatva is Moksha, which is Lord Shiva Himself, in which Lord Shiva is eternally united, eternally dwells. 'Brahmavid Brahmaiva bhavati' says the Shruti meaning one who realises the Brahman becomes Brahman itself (He was never different in the first place). Once attained, by His grace, there is no rebirth, no return to the cycle of Samsara (Shmashaana). Therefore Lord Shiva dwells in His own Atma Svarupa & hence is termed Shmashaanavaasee.</br></br>

These capacities are Eternally in His Svarupa & always at His disposal. Very rarely someone may acquire one of these qualities temporarily. The Power of Creation, Sustenance & Delusion is unique to Ishwara. Therefore He is the Only Bhagavan say Bhagavan Vedavyasa & Acharya Shankara. .</br></br>

                                Abhivaadyah is One who is 'prostrated to' by everybody meaning revered in all lokas. 'Sarva deva namaaskaarah keshavam pratigacchati' says the Vishnu purana meaning the prostrations to all Gods actually reaches Keshava.
                                'Shivasya hrdayam Vishnuh Vishnoshcha hrdayam Shivah. Yathaa Shivamayor Vishnuh evam Vishnumayah Shivah. Yathaantaram na pashyaami tathaa mey swastiraayushi' say the Puranas.</br></br>
                                An instance explains this best. During the final phase of the vanavaasa of the Pandavas, forseeing an inevitable war, Krishna encourages Arjuna to obtain the Paashupata Astra from Lord Maheshwara. Setting a precedent Krishna himself worships Lord Shiva all through an auspicious night in rigourous austerity. During this penance at an approprite moment He advises Arjuna to give an offering of a fruit to Lord Vishnu. Arjuna offers it to  Lord Krishna who is Vishnu himself. Krishna smilingly accepts it & continues with his penance with Arjuna waiting on him. Close to break of dawn Krishna, having chanted this very Sahasranama, energises his Yogic maya & asks Arjuna to join him to seek audience with Lord Shiva. They both reach the abode of Lord Shiva & wait for the Lord who Himself is meditating. The Lord acknowledges them. Krishna & Arjuna prostrate to the Lord & Arjuna observes that the fruit he had offered to Krishna the previous night, is at the feet of Lord Shiva. Krishna noticing Arjuna's thoughts, in an aside, clarifies he in turn had offered it to the Lord & hence the fruit is to be seen here. Lord Maheshwara smilingly explains that He himself is meditating upon Lord Vishnu He then promises to grant Arjuna the Paashupata Astra as a result of Krishna's prayer. That He also grants that there will be no obstacles whatsoever as a result of Krishna's austerity & asks Arjuna to perform the necessary austerities. Upon their return Indra requests Sage Narada to initiate Arjuna in the Paashupata astra vidya- is the continued history.....  Another mind blowing instance from the Mahabharata. Thus Lord Shiva is the Abhivaadyah.

                                Mahaakarmaa means He is of the form of all Karmas- Rites & Austerities. The Vedas & Puranas detail many intense & austere Karmas in the form of penance, Yajnas, etc. For eg. Soma yaagas, Paaka yajnas, etc. These complicated Yaagas & Yajnas even span many centuries carried out by continuing progeny.... All this knowledge, capabilities & everything associated with is from & to worship the Lord. 'Yajno vai Vishnuh' meaning Vishnu Himself is Yajna, explain the Vedas... That is, all these Yajnas that are performed are meant to attain Him.

                                Tapasvee means He is the real One in all austeres....The root tap means to burn, friction, suffer. Living & performing as per the norms of Dharma actually causes a feeling of immense friction & suffering to the performer as well as the associated. Foe eg. Daana. It is very difficult to offer away hard earned wealth & gains obtained thru Dharmic means. It causes great suffering, physically also, to perform austerities like Upavasa-fasting, Jaagarana- keeping awake & being involved in meditation,  etc. However all these are meant to obtain & remain in Lord Shiva's oneness. He himself remaining as Jnaana.
                                </br></br>
                                The shastras say Realisation of the Self is the highest form of Tapas and the Lord resides unperturbed in it- 'yasya jnaanamayam tapah' says the Upanishat.
                                </br></br>
                                * it causes great suffering is used in the sense that it is not easy for any commoner...

                                Bhootabhaavanah means from Whom the entire universe manifests.

Bhoota is the entities of the world; 'bhavanam bhavanaat bhaavanah' existence, to occur/manifest, One who manifests. Therefore it is from Lord Shiva this whole universe & wholeness occurs.
